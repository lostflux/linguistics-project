% One of the reasons we chose to work together on this project was because
% we had all worked with one another at some capacity in other classes
% and in the Robotics club. We knew that we could work well together and
% that we could trust each other to get the work done.
% At the start of the project, we decided to periodically
% spend time working together (aka `mini-hackathons')
% instead of splitting up the work and assigning each team member
% a specific task.

% We think this helped because debugging issues with out code,
% such us the issues we ran into with \verb|Wav2Vec|, were much
% more manageable with our combined input as opposed to each
% of us single-handedly trying to work it out.
% It was also a great chance to learn some more team-working skills
% and pick the best of each other's brains and coding abilities.

% Each component of our project --- data pre-processing, models, training,
% evaluation, writing the report, and creating the presentation ---
% had input from all three of us.
