  One of the reasons we chose to work together on this project was because
  we had all worked with one another at some capacity in other classes
  and in the Robotics club. We knew that we could work well together and
  that we could trust each other to get the work done.
  At the start of the project, we decided to periodically
  spend time working together (aka `mini-hackathons')
  instead of splitting up the work and assigning each team member
  a specific task.

  We think this helped because debugging issues with out code,
  such us the issues we ran into with \verb|Wav2Vec|, were much
  more manageable with our combined input as opposed to each
  of us single-handedly trying to work it out.
  It was also a great chance to learn some more team-working skills
  and pick the best of each other's brains and coding abilities.

  Each component of our project --- data pre-processing, models, training,
  evaluation, writing the report, and creating the presentation ---
  had equal input from all three of us.
