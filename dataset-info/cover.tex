  The dataset we used is an aggregation of four different datasets.
  Because of this reason, we felt that splitting it for submission
  may result in a non-representative sample
  since the files from each dataset are quite different.

  We have the data in our Google Drive, which can be accessed here: \\
  \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k2FYbPnaTV8RmU8VgW6sQHkum2OpaS5q?usp=sharing}.
  However, the unzipped dataset is quite huge.
  If you prefer to download the compressed version from \verb|Kaggle|,
